# HaploHammer-Snakemake
### A Snakemake wrapper for the HaploHammer pipeline 


The [HaploHammer](https://github.com/StructureFold2/HaploHammer) pipeline parses haplotypes from VCF files. The purpose of this Snakemake wrapper is to facilitate the use of HaploHammer for population-level VCF files and to eliminate the need to install any dependencies, including python 2. 

## Pre-requisites
Before running the pipeline, you must have the following installed:
* [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html)
* [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)

## Installation
To install the pipeline, simply clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Kobie-Kirven/HaploHammer-Snakemake.git
```
